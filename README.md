A very mad car game, taken to the next level...

# Notes
  __You should have the newest Java JRE / JDK installed!__

__The class you should run is Madness__, never GameSparker. This is because, in NFMM, the game runs inside of a Frame, which allows the Car Maker, Stage Maker, Antialiasing and Motion Effects buttons to work, and reduces incompatibility with newer Java versions.
  
__99% of the NFM2 tutorials won't work!__ A lot has changed since NFM2's release!

Keep in mind that __this is not the final version of the files__, and although they've been cleaned up a little bit, they need heavy improvement.

# Some of the Features
LAN multiplayer works, but there is no chat, no clans and no multiplayer dome. You do not require a full account to play, and the 3 game limit has been removed. I am not going to add online multiplayer, at least not until Omar closes down the official servers.

The car and stage limit have been hacked. There is one limit, which is sort of hardcoded into Medium, but I'd rather not mess with it.
