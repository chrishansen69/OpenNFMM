A very mad car game, taken to the next level...

# Notes
  __You should have the newest Java JRE / JDK installed!__

  __Most of the NFM2 tutorials won't work!__ A lot has changed since NFM2's release!

Keep in mind that __this is not the final version of the files__, and they are under active development. Don't download them unless you know what you're doing!

# Some of the Features
LAN multiplayer works, but there is no chat, no clans and no multiplayer dome. You do not require a full account to play, and the 3 game limit has been removed. I am not going to add online multiplayer, at least not until Omar closes down the official servers.

The car and stage size limits have been hacked. There is one limit, which is sort of hardcoded into Medium, but I'd rather not mess with it.
