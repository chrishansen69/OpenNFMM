This Agreement constitutes the entire and only agreement between the parties
and all other prior negotiations, agreements, representations and
understandings are superseded hereby. Also, it shall be construed and enforced
in accordance with the laws of the United States of America... ok no, it won't.
Don't worry.

Well, this is the part where we speak about terms and
conditions of use of the apps posted here under that... license or whatever it
actually is (it isn't that close to one).

In order to make things easier for
everyone, I've disclosed the terms in four sections, to be presented below.

  What you must know beforehand

    These terms are ALWAYS in effect. From the
	very moment you do anything of the activities mentioned in the next section, it
	is implied that you've read and accepted these terms.

    The applications
	posted here are free apps. Not exactly free in the meaning that you can get
	until the last character of its sources and show them as a big exponents of the
	open software initiative; but free in the way that you can download and use
	them for free for whatever they were made to, or something related you found
	them useful for.

    They will be available all the time, at zero-cost forever... well, at least
    while this server (also free) is up and working (Note to self: add mirrrors).

  What you can do

	You can download, use and share the apps covered under this license, totally
	free of charge.

    You may use the apps covered under this license, or part of their codes, in a
    project of yours if you feel like it. This applies for both commercial and
	non-comercial projects.

  What you must keep on mind

    The apps are delivered AS THEY ARE. They're meant to do the tasks they were
    designed for, but there's no implied or explicit warranty unless the opposite
    is stated. No exceptions.

    In case you are interested into, or manage to use any app covered under this
    license (or part of their codes), please let me know about it. I want to join
    the hype too.

    You will mention me and the stuff you used from here, in case you use it. No
    ripoffs, I will find them.

    For closed-source apps, you may prefer to use a decompiler in order to get usable
	sources. If that fails, you can try requesting the sources via e-mail. If you
	provide enough evidence of the existence and activity of your project, I might
	decide to provide you of the codes you need.

  What you shouldn't do

	You may not use the apps for activities like piracy, any sort of exploit abuses
	nor infringing the law. I'm not responsible for any inappropriate use of
	anything posted here. If you do something wrong and get caught, that's your
	problem, not mine.

    You may not monetize with these apps. No selling, for either them or part of
    their codes. Using them in the development of your own own commercial projects
    is fine though.
